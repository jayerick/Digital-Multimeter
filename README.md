# Digital-Multimeter

  The digital multimeter uses a keypad(1) ,a computer capable of RS-232 communication and a terminal, 
and a TI-MSP432 microcontroller(2). When the program is ran initially, the software will boot up and 
enter into a wait state, with instructions for entering possible modes shown in the terminal. Using 
the keypad, the user may pick to use any of these different modes. Namely, the modes include a DC 
Voltage Measurement, an AC Voltage Measurement (with both Pk-Pk and RMS voltages displayed), and a 
Frequency measurement, with button choices two (2), three (3), and four (4), respectively. Once the 
user has become familiar with the system, they can simply press the button of the next mode they 
would like to enter and it will update the display with the measurements for that mode selection. 
In the beginning, however, if the modes and their numbers are not committed to memory, pressing 
the one (1) button at any time will return to the home screen with the mode selections displayed. The 
user may then start again entering a new mode for measurement.
